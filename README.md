## Emi, an automated WordPress Starter Theme

Emi is a WordPress starter theme package that has been automated to include a generator (using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io)). The generated themes is set up with Sass and [Gulp.js](gulpjs.com) for further automation.

## Getting Started

### Install Yeoman

If you don't already have Yeoman installed, you'll need to take care of that:

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

Or, if you get errors related to permissions, try:

```
$ sudo npm install -g yo
```

### Install Emi


You can install the Emi generator using the command:

```
$ npm install -g generator-emi
```

Then, you should be able to initiate the generator (you'll want to do this within an empty directory you create for your new theme):

```
$ yo emi
```
